Next word Prediction with RNN and LSTM

//Problem Statement:
The "Sherlock Holmes Book Text Data" dataset serves as an invaluable resource for language enthusiasts
and data scientists alike, presenting an opportunity to delve into the intricate world of Sherlock Holmes'
literary prose. The challenge is to employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) architectures to develop predictive models that can accurately anticipate the next word
in a sentence. The goal is to unravel the nuanced language patterns present in the dataset, capturing the
essence of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing style. Students are tasked with building robust algorithms
that not only demonstrate proficiency in RNN and LSTM but also showcase an understanding of the
unique linguistic traits exhibited in Sherlock Holmes stories.
